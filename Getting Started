--Getting Started--
Keep in mind: this mod must be done in Creative mode
For reference to an older version, check out Flash's showcase for this mod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO_SpJBUwRg

  1. Get the NPC Editor tool from the creative inventory.
  2. Right-click on an empty block, and a window will come up with 3 labeled text boxes. Underneath those will be 3 color sliders. Next to the text boxes will be two check boxes. In the far bottom right corner of the screen will be 3 buttons.
  To exti the screen, hit the ESC key.
  The 3 textboxes are as follows:
      a. _Name_. Name your NPC whatever you wish
      b. _Texture_. This is the text for the model of your NPC. It may take some experimenting to get the right link, but you can start with https://mineskin.org/ . There, you can search their collection of skins or make your own. 
      c. _Dialogue_
  The color sliders can be manipulated to change the text color of your NPC's dialogue text.
  The checkboxes next to the textboxes
    a. _Visible?_. Thsi determines if the NPC's name is visible.
    b. _Slim_ . This slims the arms of the NPC. If they are wearing torso equipment, this will not make much visual difference.
  The three buttons in the bottom right corner of the screen
    a. _Trades_
    b. _Inventory_
    c. _Confirm_. This confirms all the changes that you've done to the NPC
    
    
-Dialogue-
 In the text box labeled _Dialogue_, type in the name of a dialogue sequence. Once that is done, confirm the change.
